# python-simple-upload
SimpleHTTP POST upload script - LAN Transfer files from any device with a web browser

Python script to serve and upload files. I use it to transfer files from my phone to my computer.

Totally unsafe:

	- no transport security (TLS, HTTPS)
	- no filename sanitization
	- no checks of any kind

This is hugly but kind of self contained.

# How to run

	python pyup.py
